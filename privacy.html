    <h1>Privacy Policy for Matcherino Support Discord Bot</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <strong class="placeholder">[CURRENT DATE - e.g., October 27, 2023]</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong class="placeholder">[Your Name/Your Organization's Name]</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of the Matcherino Support Discord Bot (the "Bot"). By adding, inviting, or using the Bot in any Discord server, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Bot.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information necessary for the Bot to function and provide its services. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commands and Content:</strong> When you interact with the Bot by sending commands or messages to it, we collect the content of those communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration Data:</strong> If the Bot allows for server-specific configurations (e.g., custom prefixes, enabled/disabled features), we store these settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Information Collected Automatically via Discord API:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Information:</strong> Your Discord User ID. We do <strong>not</strong> typically collect or store your Discord username or discriminator directly unless it's part of a command log for troubleshooting or moderation, and even then, it's used in line with Discord's own policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Information:</strong> The Discord Server ID and Channel ID where the Bot is used or commands are issued. This is necessary to deliver responses and manage Bot functionality within specific servers and channels.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may log commands used, frequency of use, and general interaction patterns to understand how the Bot is being used, to troubleshoot issues, and to improve its functionality. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized where possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Information We Do NOT Intentionally Collect:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, such as your real name (unless it's your Discord username), address, phone number, email address (unless you provide it directly for support), financial information, or government-issued identifiers through the Bot's standard operations.</li>
                <li>The Bot does not read or store messages in your server that are not direct commands or mentions to the Bot.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

        <li><strong>To Improve the Bot:</strong> To understand how users interact with the Bot, identify areas for improvement, develop new features, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide Support:</strong> To respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot problems, and provide assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>To Enforce Our Terms:</strong> To enforce our Terms of Service and prevent abuse of the Bot.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security Purposes:</strong> To detect and prevent fraudulent or malicious activity.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers who help us operate, maintain, and improve the Bot (e.g., hosting providers). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
            <ul>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation or a request from law enforcement.</li>
                <li>Protect and defend our rights or property.</li>
                <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Bot.</li>
                <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Bot or the public.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties if we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you with third parties for research, analysis, or other purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's services, fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Command logs or usage data may be retained for a period necessary for troubleshooting, improvement, and security analysis (e.g., <strong class="placeholder">[Specify a timeframe, like 30-90 days, or "as long as deemed necessary for operational purposes"]</strong>).</li>
        <li>Server configuration data is retained as long as the Bot is active on that server, or until it is explicitly removed or reset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can request the deletion of specific data associated with your User ID or server by contacting us (see Section 9).</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> The right to request access to the personal information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> The right to request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> The right to request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., if we are required to retain it by law or for legitimate operational purposes).</li>
        <li><strong>Object to Processing:</strong> The right to object to our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided in Section 9. Please note that removing the Bot from your server will stop future data collection from that server. Some data may reside on Discord's platform and is subject to Discord's own Privacy Policy and data management tools.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include <strong class="placeholder">[Briefly mention types of measures, e.g., "secure hosting environments," "access controls," "data encryption where feasible"]</strong>. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us or the Bot.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under this age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services (Discord & Matcherino)</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the data processed by our Bot.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Your use of Discord is subject to Discord's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Discord.</li>
        <li><strong>Matcherino:</strong> The Bot provides information related to the Matcherino platform. Your use of Matcherino services is subject to Matcherino's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy and updating the "Last Updated" date (e.g., via a bot announcement or a message in a designated support server). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
