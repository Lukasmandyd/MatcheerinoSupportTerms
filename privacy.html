        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Files:</strong> Most configuration data, warnings, ratings, claims, registration settings, and pending registrations are stored in JSON files on the server where the Bot is hosted (typically in a <code>data/</code> subdirectory or root directory for files like <code>staff_roles.json</code>, <code>warnings.json</code>, <code>ticket_greeting_settings.json</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>In-Memory Data:</strong> Some data, such as active giveaway details, invite caches, and DM history for the <code>/read</code> command, is stored in the Bot's memory and is lost when the Bot restarts.</li>
            <li><strong>Log Files:</strong> Bot operational logs are stored in a <code>logs/</code> directory on the server where the Bot is hosted.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect. However, no internet-based service is 100% secure.</li>
            <li><strong>Discord's Storage:</strong> Information transmitted through Discord (messages, user profiles, etc.) is also stored by Discord according to its own Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Configuration Data & Persistent Records:</strong> Data stored in JSON files (like warnings, ratings, server settings) is retained as long as the Bot is operational or until it is explicitly cleared or overwritten by Bot commands or manual intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>In-Memory Data:</strong> Retained only for the current session of the Bot and is cleared upon restart.</li>
            <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Bot operational logs and logs sent to designated Discord channels are retained according to the logging configuration and Discord's policies, respectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending Registrations:</strong> Cleared after successful processing, cancellation, or timeout (e.g., 24 hours for confirmation).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> The right to request access to the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> The right to request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us or the Bot.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under this age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services (Discord & Matcherino)</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the data processed by our Bot.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Your use of Discord is subject to Discord's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Discord.</li>
            <li><strong>Matcherino:</strong> The Bot provides information related to the Matcherino platform. Your use of Matcherino services is subject to Matcherino's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy and updating the "Last Updated" date (e.g., via a bot announcement or a message in a designated support server). You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
